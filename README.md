# Recent updates

### Fixed stop/start key not stopping

### Full numbis support + auto start
 - Get the new image needed for this [here](https://github.com/loxersoun2369189-wq/Winter-Normal-Macro/blob/main/Resources/Winter/ResetMount.png)
```python
AUTO_START = True # if true upon failure it will auto restart, this also starts the macro when you launch the script
USE_NIMBUS = True # Use the nimbus cloud instead of newsman (more consistent + better)
```

### Added loop-wide lost detection
Restarts program upon lost + resets the mount too. MAKE SURE TO ADD NEW PICTURE IN ``RESOURCES\WINTER!``

```python
detect_loss() # detects + restarts 
reset_mount() # resets the mount state to unmounted
```

## Common Fixes
Mega downloads can occasionally corrupt files, which breaks either **Python** or **Tesseract**.

### Tesseract issues
If Tesseract stops working or the macro can’t detect text:

- Re‑download the files and unzip again, **or**
- Install a clean version of Tesseract from:  
  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/releases/tag/5.5.0  
- Clear the old Tesseract folder before installing
- Optionally add the **Tesseract directory** (not the exe) to your system PATH

### Python issues
If Python fails to run or packages are missing:

- Install a clean Python **3.13.11**
- Install the required packages listed here:
